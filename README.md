# ctSVG_Paper

This repository contains the code and results in the manuscript "Identifying cell-type-specific spatially variable genes with ctSVG".

## Simulation study

The code and results for each analysis can be found under the corresponding `simulation/<dataset>/method/<method_name>/` folder. For example, the code and result for CTSV on the human colon cancer dataset are located in `simulation/human_crc/method/ctsv/`. For some methods such as ctSVG, the code is stored separately under `simulation/code_method/ctsvg/`.

## Reproducibility analysis

The reproducibility analysis was conducted on a rectangular region of each dataset. The code and results for the original datasets are available under `reproducibility/full/<method_name>/`, while those for the subsampled datasets can be found under `reproducibility/down/<method_name>/`.
